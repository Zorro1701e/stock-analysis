# Refactoring Code Module 2: Refactor Harder
		
Section 1. What’s the Deal with Refactoring?
The module 2 Challenge asked, “What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?”

Initially I was confused by this. I thought refactoring code was like changing information based on new data. 
But the more I worked on this module it almost seemed like we “trimmed the fat” 
This made it a little easier to read and understand by potential clients. 

Section 2. The Real Deal
The Module 2 challenge also asked, “How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?”
Pro: Refactoring you could look for potential spelling errors or wording mistakes that may make the document hard to read. 
Con: on the other hand, you may accidentally add errors to working code.
